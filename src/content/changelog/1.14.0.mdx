# October 2025 - V1.14.0

✨✨✨ The most recent release brings some urgent new features and bug fixes that should enhance your experience. Check out what’s changed.

### 🚀 **Highlights**

#### **Progressive Migration**

**CloudPilot AI** now supports **node-level gradual migration**, allowing users to progressively bring existing nodes under CloudPilot AI management without migrating all nodes at once.
* Enables gradual node onboarding into CloudPilot AI management based on business and stability needs, following the pace of the PoC.
* Supports maintaining normal operation of existing nodes during the migration process to avoid business interruptions.

#### **Workload Autoscaler**

**CloudPilot AI** now supports the **Workload Autoscaler** component, which automatically analyzes each workload’s actual resource usage and dynamically adjusts its **Requests** and **Limits** configurations to achieve higher resource efficiency and cost savings.
* Automatically adjusts workload **Requests** and **Limits** based on real resource usage.
* Provides flexible configuration options to avoid updates during peak hours and minimize business impact.
* Supports multiple update modes, including **InPlace**, to accommodate different business needs.
* Offers powerful visualization to track each workload’s resource usage and adjustment history.
* Supports multi-select and bulk operations, enabling one-click optimization for all workloads.

#### **Pod Mutation**

**CloudPilot AI** introduces the new **Pod Mutation** feature, allowing users to select specific groups of workloads and inject custom configurations to optimize their scheduling and operation on **Spot instances**.
* Supports selecting a group of workloads via the **PodMutation CR** and injecting specific configurations.
* Supports injection of configurations such as **Node Affinity**, **Tolerations**, **Labels**, and **Annotations**.
* Enables **workload-level gradual migration**, allowing workloads to be progressively brought under **CloudPilot AI** management.

        operator: "Exists"
    nodeSelector:
      "node.cloudpilot.ai/managed": "true"
```

#### **Terraform**

**CloudPilot AI** now supports installation and configuration management via **Terraform**, making it easier for users to integrate CloudPilot AI into their existing **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** workflows.
* Provision and manage EKS clusters with CloudPilot AI integration
* Automated agent and rebalance component installation
* Node pool and node class management (including custom Karpenter JSON)
* Workload cost optimization (rebalance, spot-friendly, min non-spot replicas)
* Seamless AWS CLI and kubeconfig integration

### ⚙️ Enhancements

* The **Node Repair** feature will now remove some Pods from a node before removing the node itself, reducing the impact on workloads.
* Optimized the **Simulation** computation logic, significantly reducing **Agent** CPU usage after a **Rebalance** is completed.
* Optimized the issue where, in some cases, the **Optimizer** might evict interrupted **Spot** nodes too slowly due to **PDB** constraints.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the **Workload Diversity** feature could, in some cases, ignore existing OnDemand nodes and cause Pods to be rescheduled.
* Fixed a caching latency issue in the **Webhook** component under certain conditions.
* Fixed the display of **Zone-related information** in the Demo cluster.
* Fixed inaccurate calculations for **Non-Spot Pods** of Workloads in some cases.
* Fixed an issue where certain components could prematurely perform operations such as **Evict** during the **Rebalance** process.
* Fixed synchronization issues for **cluster-related information** under certain conditions.
